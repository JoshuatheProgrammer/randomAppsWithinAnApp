So i got bored one night, and decided to code a fully functioning password locker 

# How_to_use_and_what_is_what

# 1_Password_Locker 
The password locker saves passwords locally [ i could have found a cheap way to save the passwords elsewhere but i decided locally ]
In my opinion its secure enough that people will not randomly stumble upon the list but not secure enough that if someone hacked your computer they can most likely find it. If they know the file name.

# 2_File_Locker
I do not suggest using this part of the application, it has functionallity but i was mainly just designing it. 
The lock feature works, but unlocking an folder or file will not work resulting in a permentalty locked file. Unless you use some different software to unlock it.
To use this press "Generate Key and Salt" 
You can navigate directories with the combo box, it loads all available hard drives. Just press "Load Directories"
Create Folder is mainly a testing feautre for my purposes to see if the application worked or not. Locking worked Unlocking not so much.

# 3_Encrypted_Text_Locker
This one is pretty self explainitory
Encrypt text button has the fields for 
Writing text you want to encrypt and a box that shows the encrypted text.
Same with decrypted text.

You have save encrypted text to file which saves the encrypted text field
load encrypted text that you want to decrypt. loads into decrypt field.
load decrypted text into the encryption field. [ basically load any .txt file with text ]
and clear text fields for encrypted and decrypted.

# 4_Personal_Locker
This locker has no design or concept yet. just sorta blanked on it. but i just left it within the application. no purpose once so ever. just a blank windowsformApp.
